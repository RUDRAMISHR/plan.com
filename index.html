    <p>The God promised the Abraham that he will give him a baby because Abraham doesn’t have any child. As the God said so it will always perfect but the brain of humans is not always perfect. Sarah used her brain because it was so much time without a child. As the chapter 1 points that our brain is not perfect but the brain of God is perfect. Sarah used her imperfect brain and born Ismailia the ones who wasn’t from God. God planned other but the invasion of imperfect brain of Sarah led to delay of his child who was from God named Isaac. Now when he was born Ismailia was jealous of Isaac. This indicated the part of our life when we are growing in our lives spiritually the people don’t like us and won’t us to not grow in God. Now when the Isaac was going to be scarified the Abraham had two options, He can obey the God or he can obey himself that is not to sacrifice but he followed God and obeyed him and God saved his child and gave them blessing. This shows the part of our live when we only obey God and he blesses us and let us gets out from troubles. Now if we go deeper we see that God has a prefect plan for all those who believe in him or the selected ones from the God. He had plan in Abraham life, Isaac life, Jacob life, Joseph life and your life and my life and our family life. He had plan from beginning to the end. Because he is the beginning and he is ending. If you believe in the God who is in the heaven you also have to believe that he has plan for you. If he had plan for you he also has a plan for me he also had plan for other. He had plan that cannot be understand but it works. I also have seen this in my life the plan of the God. He always knows the future that’s why his plan is perfect. If you invade in his plan you will hurt yourself spiritually. If you go deeper in the bible you will see that God had a perfect plan for everyone. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Paul and many other. Jesus said we are the light of the world if he wants us to do something so we have to do it. The Abraham did just as God said, Isaac did the same, Jacob also and Joseph did the same. All did the same thing as God said them. When the Joseph was in Egypt God had the plan for Joseph because the all thing happened in the Joseph life was a plan from God. If God does something so it is his plan but if we do something without asking him so the plan might not work or it might work no guarantee of what the plan work but if God does it, it always work.</p>
<p>Reference to the bible about this is in Jeremiah 29:11 “For I know the plans I have for you”</p>
<p>He always knows the plan and how it will work because he is the creator. He knows the human brain and how the human thinks. He can change the human mind for you. If he can give he can also take if he can create world he can also create the perfect plan about you because he is almighty. There was a man named Lazarus the brother of marry. He was ill and marry wants the Jesus to come to save him from death. Jesus didn’t go until the death of Lazarus. It was also the plan of God because Jesus wanted to show a big miracle. Lazarus was dead because the God wants to show a big plan and a perfect plan that never fails. If Lazarus never died so Jesus can’t show the miracle that was going to happen in that place one more thing we can observe in the life of Jesus Christ that we will discuss in the another chapter </p>
<p>Now we see that Jesus is the son of God, He can protect himself from Jews that wanted him to crucify at the cross. But Jesus didn’t protect him because he had a perfect plan to rise from the dead. Also in the many places of the bible it is written that for that written in the Old Testament can complete. A pre planned thing was there before the formation of the earth by the God because he has a perfect plan for the Jesus Christ, You and me. As written that I knew you before the creation of the World. If you read that you will find that it indicates that he knows you before the creation of the World and he has plans for you as written that “For I know the plans I have for you”. God always knows you wants you that you understand his plan and not to use your brain because the brain of the man is imperfect but not In the case of God because he is always perfect and we have to obey him and never to ignore him because now if you are on the God post its because him and if you are not it’s also because him as he had plan for you from the beginning to the end. God said only one thing to Abraham that Walk in my presence and be perfect he had a perfect plan for everyone this is only a mustard teaching of Jesus. Jesus is the expanding universe of which any revelations never end.</p>
